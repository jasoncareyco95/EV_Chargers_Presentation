# Project Overview

## Context



## Our Goals

- Using semi-realistic conditions along a simulated trip, we want to show an electric vehicle will either successfully complete the trip or, upon failure, a coordinate point will be collected and used to determine where new stations would improve the success rate of future trips

- Additionally, applying machine learning methods like K-Means Clustering and Affinity Propagation, we aim to suggest the minimum number of stations that would provide a statistically significant reduction in failure rates

- Both objectives should serve to reduce the amount of electric vehicle drivers that attempt to complete a trip in Colorado and are unable to reliably access electricity to recharge their vehicles

## Taking Action



# Data

## Inbound Sources

The data used to run our simulations and create a foundation for our models is collected from the following locations:

## Electric Vehicle Charging Stations

- Our charging stations data table consists of the following features giving us insights into characteristics of each publicly available charging station in the state

```{r}
#| echo: false

d_chg_stations <-
  v_chg_stations %>%
  sf::read_sf() %>%
  sf::st_drop_geometry() %>%
  head(n = 6) %>%
  gt::gt() %>%
  gt::tab_header(title = "Public Charging Station Locations in Colorado") %>%
  gt::cols_label(
    street_add = "Address",
    city = "City",
    state = "State",
    zip = "ZIP",
    l1_ports = "Level 1 Ports",
    l2_ports = "Level 2 Ports",
    l3_ports = "DC Fast Charge Ports",
    sum_ports = "Total Ports",
    ev_network = "Charging Network",
    longitude = "Longitude",
    latitude = "Latitude",
    ev_sockets = "Compatible Sockets"
  ) %>%
  gt::tab_footnote(
    footnote = "Data shows first 6 of 1,698 station locations, with the data last collected on February 3rd, 2023"
  ) %>%
  gt::as_raw_html()

d_chg_stations

```

## Electric Vehicle Sockets

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- When setting up our simulations we determine which vehicle is going to be used and filter the charging station table to compatible stations

- To accomplish this, we've encoded socket compatibility with the map shown:

- *Note*: We ignore NEMA520 and NEMA515 plugs because none of the top 15 electric vehicles by market share have compatibility with these sockets^[And they make up a fraction of overall station locations!]
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false

d_ev_sockets <- 
  dplyr::tibble(
    socket_type = c("CCS1", "J1772", "Tesla", "CHAdeMO"),
    value = c(1:4)
  ) %>%
  gt::gt(rowname_col = "socket_type") %>%
  gt::tab_header(title = "Socket Compatibility Map") %>%
  gt::tab_stubhead(label = "Socket Type") %>%
  gt::cols_label(value = "Value") %>%
  gt::as_raw_html()

d_ev_sockets

```

## Colorado Electric Vehicle Registration Data 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
- Exploring the electric vehicle registration data for Colorado we determined that the 15 vehicles shown would be used in our simulations

- *Note*: Socket/plug compatibility is also included in this table for our simulations, however, is omitted here for clarity
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
```{r}
#| echo: false

d_ev_mkt_share <-
  v_ev_mkt_share %>%
  readr::read_csv(show_col_types = FALSE) %>%
  dplyr::select(-sockets) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(mkt_share = mkt_share / 100) %>%
  gt::gt(rowname_col = "index") %>%
  gt::tab_header(title = "Electric Vehicles in Colorado by Market Share") %>%
  gt::cols_label(
    vehicle_make = "Manufacturer",
    vehicle_model = "Model",
    range = "Range",
    mkt_share = "Market Share (%)"
  ) %>%
  gt::tab_footnote("Based on active registrations with the DMV") %>%
  gt::fmt_integer(range) %>%
  gt::fmt_percent(mkt_share) %>%
  gt::as_raw_html()

## Colorado Primary and Secondary Roadways

- We utilize TIGER/Line Shapefiles for when we make adjustments to our machine learning model suggestions 

- These adjustments ensure that model suggestions are in valid locations along a primary or secondary roadway and in an appropriate zone with capacity for a new station to be built

- Shapefiles containing geometric features tend to be messy so here's a plot instead:

```{r}
#| echo: false

raster::getData(country = "USA", level = 1) %>%
  .[.$NAME_1 == "Colorado",] %>%
  raster::plot()

v_co_roads %>%
  sf::read_sf() %>%
  sf::st_geometry() %>%
  plot(add = TRUE)

```

## Outbound Schema

- After running the simulations, a schema has been created using the vehicle number and seed of the simulation number as keys to link all associated records

- The data frames in this schema include:
  - Route details
  - Charging station uses
  - Vehicle information
  - Simulation outcomes

# Methodology

## Vehicles

- Our project takes a vehicle specific approach to generating new charging station suggestions

- Each electric vehicle has specific characteristics such as range, socket compatibility, build quality, estimated useful battery life, etc

- A universal model would be too general to suggest meaningful station locations for the consumer of these vehicles because of the diversity in each model

## Route Generation

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Routes created by our model adhere to a few constraints:
  - They must exceed the range of the vehicle being simulated
  - They must stay within Colorado

- Routes also attempt to mimic population density with:
  - 60% of routes originating from the Greater Denver Metropolitan Area
  - 35% of routes originating from the Greater Front Range (Colorado Springs to Fort Collins)
  - 5% of routes originating from anywhere within Colorado
  
- Avoiding situations where outcomes could be 'false positives' by using charging stations outside of Colorado was critical

## Route Simulation

- Simulations attempt to mimic semi-realistic conditions by following these steps:
  - Select a randomized starting position within our starting polygons
  - Select a randomized ending position at *least* the range of the vehicle away from the starting position
  - Create a connecting route between the two points
  - Begin 'driving' by reducing the vehicle's battery according to the distance traveled
  - At 30% battery capacity locate the closest charging stations and determine if they are **available**:
    - We use a Poisson distribution generation function to determine if based on random arrivals the number of plugs at the station are full or if at least one is available for use
  - If there are plugs available re-route to the station and recharge to **80%** battery capacity^[We recharge to 80% capacity because charging above 80% negatively impacts the useful life of the battery in the vehicle]
  - Once recharged, continue to our destination before turning around and repeating the same process on the way back to the starting position

## Initial Incomplete Trips

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Each vehicle was subjected to approximately 20,000 simulated trips for a large enough sample of failures to create meaningful clusters
