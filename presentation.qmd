# Project Overview {background-image="presentation_files/images/slide_background.png"}

## Context {background-image="presentation_files/images/slide_background.png"}

- If you were interested in financing a new car, specifically an electric vehicle, which would be the most reliable?

- Is the EPA estimated range on the vehicle enough?

- What happens if I run out of charge? Are there enough accessible stations I can get to to recharge?

## Our Goals {background-image="presentation_files/images/slide_background.png"}

- Use semi-realistic conditions in simulated routes taken by electric vehicles to predict possible areas where you may run out of energy

- Apply machine learning models to suggest new charging stations in optimal locations

## Taking Action {background-image="presentation_files/images/slide_background.png"}

- Our predictions are based on multiple factors, including:
  - Characteristics of the top 15 electric vehicles by market share in Colorado, such as:
    - EPA estimated range
    - Plug compatibility (J1772, CCS1, Tesla, CHAdeMO)
  - Pre-existing and planned locations for charging stations
  - Availability of charging stations based on the number of charging ports at each station and random interarrival times of consumers
  - Zoning restrictions within cities and counties where predictions are located
  - Electric grid capacity at prediction locations

# Data {background-image="presentation_files/images/slide_background.png"}

## Electric Vehicle Sockets {background-image="presentation_files/images/slide_background.png"}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- When setting up our simulations we determine which vehicle is going to be used and filter the charging station table to compatible stations

- To accomplish this, we've encoded socket compatibility with the map shown:

- *Note*: We ignore NEMA520 and NEMA515 plugs because none of the top 15 electric vehicles by market share have compatibility with these sockets^[And they make up a fraction of overall station locations!]

## Colorado Primary and Secondary Roadways {background-image="presentation_files/images/slide_background.png"}

- We reference TIGER/Line Shapefiles for when we make adjustments to our machine learning model suggestions 

- These adjustments ensure that model suggestions are in valid locations along a primary or secondary roadways

## Outbound Schema {background-image="presentation_files/images/slide_background.png"}

- After running the simulations, a schema has been created using the vehicle number and seed of the simulation number as keys to link all associated records

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
- The data frames in this schema include:
  - Route details
  - Charging station uses
  - Vehicle information
  - Simulation outcomes
  
- This is a sample of our simulation outcomes table, where 0 is a successful trip and 1 is unsuccessful

# Methodology {background-image="presentation_files/images/slide_background.png"}

## Vehicles {background-image="presentation_files/images/slide_background.png"}

- Our project takes a vehicle specific approach to generating new charging station suggestions

- Each electric vehicle has specific characteristics such as range, socket compatibility, build quality, estimated useful battery life, etc

- A universal model would be too general to suggest meaningful station locations for the consumer of these vehicles because of the diversity in each model

## Route Generation {.incremental background-image="presentation_files/images/slide_background.png"}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Routes created by our model adhere to a few constraints:
  - They must exceed the range of the vehicle being simulated
  - They must stay within Colorado

- Routes also attempt to mimic population density with:
  - 60% of routes originating from the Greater Denver Metropolitan Area
  - 35% of routes originating from the Greater Front Range (Colorado Springs to Fort Collins)
  - 5% of routes originating from anywhere within Colorado
  
- Avoiding situations where outcomes could be 'false positives' by using charging stations outside of Colorado was critical

## Route Simulation {.incremental background-image="presentation_files/images/slide_background.png"}

- Simulations attempt to mimic semi-realistic conditions by following these steps:
  - Select a randomized starting position within our starting polygons
  - Select a randomized ending position at *least* the range of the vehicle away from the starting position
  - Create a connecting route between the two points
  - Begin 'driving' by reducing the vehicle's battery according to the distance traveled
  - At 30% battery capacity locate the closest charging stations and determine if they are **available**:
    - We use a Poisson distribution generation function to determine if based on random arrivals the number of plugs at the station are full or if at least one is available for use
  - If there are plugs available re-route to the station and recharge to **80%** battery capacity^[We recharge to 80% capacity because charging above 80% negatively impacts the useful life of the battery in the vehicle]
  - Once recharged, continue to our destination before turning around and repeating the same process on the way back to the starting position

## Poisson Distribution {auto-animate="true" background-image="presentation_files/images/slide_background.png"}

- A distribution used to model the probability of an event occurring given the number of events that will occur, and the average occurrence rate ($$\lambda$$) over a period of time

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

- Mathematically expressed as<br>
$$P\left(x, \lambda\right) = \frac{{e^{ - \lambda } \lambda ^x }}{{x!}}$$ for $$x = 0, 1, 2, ...$$

- We can plot what this may look like over $$n = 30$$ events using the following code:

```{r}

## How many events will occur?
events <- c(0:30)

## Probability Mass Function
pmf <- dpois(x = events, lambda = 8)

## Make a data frame
pmf_df <- data.frame(events, pmf)

## Plot the Poisson Distribution
p <- ggplot(
  data = pmf_df, 
  mapping = aes(
    x = events,
    y = pmf
  )) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Poisson Distribution",
    subtitle = "With x = 30, lambda = 8",
    x = "Events",
    y = "Probability"
  ) +
  theme_light()

- In future iterations of this project we aim to enhance our simulation conditions:
  - Elevation should factor into energy consumption
  - Weather and temperature likely have an adverse effect on range
  
- We also plan to research more into the cost of removing inefficient station locations in favor of consolidating ports with minimal network reliability impact

# Conclusion {background-image="presentation_files/images/slide_background.png"}

## Achievements {background-image="presentation_files/images/slide_background.png"}

- Using our simulation algorithm we were able to reduce the number of failed trips by suggesting the fewest necessary charging stations in key locations

- The largest reduction
